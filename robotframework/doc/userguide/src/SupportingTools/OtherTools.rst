External tools
==============

There are plenty of external tools that can be used with Robot Framework.
These tools include test data editor RIDE_, extensions for various IDEs and
text editors, plugins to continuous integration systems and build tools,
and so on.

These tools are developed as separate projects independently from Robot
Framework itself. For a list of the available tools see
http://robotframework.org/#tools.

.. note:: Some supporting tools used to be distributed with Robot Framework
          itself. Nowadays all those tools are also available separately and
          they were removed both from the repository and source distribution
          in Robot Framework 2.8.6.
